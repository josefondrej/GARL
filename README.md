GRAPH ATTENTION REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 

Abstract
In this study, we propose a graph attention reinforcement learning (GARL) ap-
proach for the stochastic optimal control problem in asset pricing. Our approach
is based on a classical factor model that is redesigned as a multi-class classi-
fication problem. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention
mechanisms and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, specifically
the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Our GARL approach is
evaluated using synthetic simulated data as a benchmark. Results indicate that
our proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and
efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of GNNs with attention
mechanisms and DRL in the context of stochastic optimal control in asset pric-
ing is an effective approach, particularly when the problem is redesigned as a
multi-class classification problem and evaluated with synthetic simulated data.
